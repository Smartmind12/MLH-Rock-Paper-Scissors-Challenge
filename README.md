# MLH-Rock-Paper-Scissors-Challenge

Be it Playing with your friends to show them who is champion or trying to win a chance at being a team leader; we all have played one simple game "ROCK PAPER SCISSORS".
If you’re unfamiliar, rock paper scissors is a hand game for two or more players. Participants say “rock, paper, scissors” and then simultaneously form their hands into the shape of a rock (a fist), a piece of paper (palm facing downward), or a pair of scissors (two fingers extended). 

The rules are straightforward that actions of the players are compared with each other and winner is decided accordingly:
1. Rock can break a Scissors by smashing it so player with the action of Rock wins against player with action of Scissors.
2. Paper can wrap around or cover a Rock so player with the action of Paper wins against player with action of Rock.
3. Scissors can cut or slice a Paper so player with the action of Scissors wins against player with action of Paper.
4. TIE is declared when the players have choosen the same action.
